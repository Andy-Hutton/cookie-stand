    <h2>Pat's Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Pat has come up with a idea, by combining his love for sweets and his
      passion for healthy ecosystems he has developed a recipe for a coffee-time
      confection. These are called Salmon Cookies, they are made into the shape
      of a salmon and are suitable for both humans and salmon to enjoy.
