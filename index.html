      <h2>Pat's Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Pat has come up with a idea, by combining his love for sweets and his
        passion for healthy ecosystems he has developed a recipe for a
        coffee-time confection. These are called Salmon Cookies, they are made
        into the shape of a salmon and are suitable for both humans and salmon
        to enjoy.

      <h2>Our Mission Statment</h2>
      <p>
        Pat set out with just a couple of sites about 50 years ago, to now
        having more than 200 fish farms operateing in Scotland, producing more
        than 150,000 tonnes of salmon a year. Farmed salmon are usually just fed
        on processed feed yet our aim to please not just your pallet, BUT we
        want the salmon to enjoy the cookies too!
